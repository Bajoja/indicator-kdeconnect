to compile you should have
	gtk+-3.0-dev
	libappindicator3-dev
	
on Ubuntu:
-> sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
-> sudo apt install libappindicator-dev

on fedora:
-> sudo dnf install gtk3-devel
-> sudo dnf install libappindicator-devel

Obviously you should install kdeconnect 1.0.0 or up to use the features

compile:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
	make
	sudo make install

enjoy!
