to compile you should have
        cmake
	gtk+-3.0-dev
	libappindicator3-dev
	valac

on Ubuntu:
-> sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
-> sudo apt install libappindicator3-dev
-> sudo apt install libappindicator-dev
-> sudo apt install cmake
-> sudo apt install valac 

on Fedora:
-> sudo dnf install gtk3-devel
-> sudo dnf install libappindicator-devel
-> sudo dnf install libappindicator-gtk3-devel
-> sudo dnf install cmake
-> sudo dnf install vala-devel


Obviously you should install kdeconnect 1.0.0 or up to use the features

compile:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
	make
	sudo make install

uninstall: 
	sudo make uninstall

enjoy!
